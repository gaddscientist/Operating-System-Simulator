1. Rearrange hierarchy to better represent a real system
main
->start OS
--->start cpu/clock/scheduler/dispatcher
--->create processes from template

2. Implement Round Robin scheduling
2.5 Implement preemption for sjf

3. Implement system clock instead of int counter

4. Implement C++ threading. Consider running IO cycles on separate thread?
